Hello! My name is Sami :) I'm a Front End Developer with 3 years of professional experience. 

This has been an incredibly fun challenge to work on! First, I focused on laying out the UI to match the mockups, then had a good time experimenting with adding animations through out the site along with an R3F element!

## Tech
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- React Three Fiber
- svgo

## Animations
- Hero Section Rectangles & words fading in
- Mouse scrolling down the squiggle
- Typing animation on the Retro Computer
- Logos fading in on mobile
- R3F sphere / text band rotating
- Audit score meters interpolating from 0 - 100 

## Next Steps
- Update rotating TextBand to render svg logos instead
- Improve lighting on the 3D sphere to include highlights
- Animate the lego blocks falling into place 
- Get vertical lines on Logo section to render all the way to the bottom of the squiggle
